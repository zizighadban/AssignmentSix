## Interpretation of non-trivial customer requirements
3 - We interpreted this as taking in a name or partial name and returning ONE customer that matches, we chose to use first name.

4 - We interpreted this as allowing the user to insert how many customers they want to see and the offset (i.e. from which index in the db).

8 - We interpreted this requirement as wanting us to sum all invoice totals for each customer and listing them with customer ID and the sum from the highest total sum to lowest.
